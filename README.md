# Pokemona-V2
Recreation of the Pokemon Showdown teambuilder, made for Rejuvenation.

In the past I started a project identical to this one(that's why it's called V2), but a lot changed since then.
I could just continue the old project, but I should change all the structure so it's probably better to create it from the top.

The project will allow the user to create a Pokemon Rejuvenation team. This will implicate 2 main things:
1. There are no formats differently from Showdown(atm)
2. This teambuilder will include Rejuvenation's Crests, which gives many unused Pokemons a chance
3. Only Pok√®mon available in Rejuvenation Walkthrough will be in this teambuilder

And for now it's everything, I will update the README file when my ADHD won't kick in(LMAO).
