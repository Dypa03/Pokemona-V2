# Pokemona-V2
Recreation of the Pokemon Showdown teambuilder, made for Rejuvenation.

In the past I started a project identical to this one(that's why it's called V2), but a lot changed since then.
I could just continue the old project, but I should change all the structure so it's probably better to create it from the top.

The project will allow the user to create a Pokemon Rejuvenation team. This will implicate 2 main things:
1. This teambuilder will include Rejuvenation's Crests, which gives many unused Pokemons a chance
2. Only Pok√®mon available in Rejuvenation Walkthrough will be in this teambuilder
3. When creating a team instead of formats there will be Chapters! Since certain pokemons, moves and items are avaliable after a certain chapter in the walktrhough, the database will only show what is avaliable in that chapter.

And for now it's everything, I will update the README file when my ADHD won't kick in(LMAO).
