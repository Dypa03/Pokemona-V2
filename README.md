# Pokemona-V2
Recreation of the Pokemon Showdown teambuilder, made for Rejuvenation.

In the past I started a project identical to this one(that's why it's called V2), but a lot changed since then.
I could just continue the old project, but I should change all the structure so it's probably better to create it from the top.

The project will allow the user to create a Pokemon Rejuvenation team. This will implicate 2 main things:
1. This teambuilder will include Rejuvenation's Crests, which gives many unused Pokemons a chance
2. Only Pokèmon available in Rejuvenation Walkthrough will be in this teambuilder
3. When creating a team instead of formats there will be Chapters! Since certain pokemons, moves and items are avaliable after a certain chapter in the walktrhough, the database will only show what is avaliable in that chapter.

And for now it's everything, I will update the README file when my ADHD won't kick in(or when it will...idk).

The DB image is not 100% accurate cause... well I had to pay 16€/month for DB designer and... I'm not gonna do that, Caitlyn skins are more important

-------------------------------------------------------------------
The project is officially in MEGA standby. I have to be real with myself, I'm doing this project cause I need a portfolio and not because I'm actually curious and enthusiastic about it. It's not that I don't like it, maybe I did at the beginning, but atm I just trying to force myself, and that's not healthy to me.
So I'll probably start another project, maybe something really small first.
